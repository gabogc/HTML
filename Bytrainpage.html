      <h2> Analysis </h2>
      <p> They also show offTrain shots. they shows us sri lanka atmosphere.
        music,
        mainline road
        title goes after intro. and after starts the Narration.
        looks like in documentary style narration is without music.


        <p> Script
          General to specific
          it introduces us to Sri lanka,
          is a journey. starts in sri lanka, then in the train station, buying tickets.
          20 seconds of interview is enough.
          train station footage
after showing us someone, they speak to us about that person

speak a bit about the political situation.
made by human labor
history of railway
